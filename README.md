# Conditions of Language Dynamics

This repository contains the lab materials for the course taught at the University of Zurich for the master's program on Evolutionary Linguistics. 

## Syntactic constraints
This lab is adapted from [Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io)'s lab given at the University of Edinburgh for the Simulating Langauge course. All the materials for this course can be found in [Simon Kirby](https://github.com/smkirby/simlang)'s ``GitHub`` repository.

The lab is written using Jupyter python notebooks, you can open the notebook and interact with it using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CarmenSaldana/Conditions-of-Language-Dynamics/master) without having to worry about installing Jupyter notebooks or the required python dependencies.
