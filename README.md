# Conditions of Language Dynamics

This repository contains the lab materials for the course taught at the University of Zurich for the master's program on Evolutionary Linguistics. 

## Syntactic constraints
This lab is adapted from [Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io)'s lab given at the University of Edinburgh for the Simulating Langauge course. 

The lab is written using Jupyter python notebook, you can open the notebook and interact with it using [Binder](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/carmensaldana-c-nguage-dynamics-c22xii0q/tree) without having to worry about installing Jupyter notebooks or the required python dependencies.
