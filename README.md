#Conditions of Language Dynamics

This repository contains the lab materials for the course. 

##Syntactic constraints
This lab is adapted from [Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io)lab given at the University of Edinburgh for the Simulating Langauge course. 

The lab is written using Jupyter python notebook, you can open the notebook and interact with it using [Binder](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/carmensaldana-c-nguage-dynamics-c22xii0q/tree) without having to worry about installing Jupyter notebooks or the required python dependencies.
